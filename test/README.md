Test Classify
======================================================

---

To test Classify you:

* Need to install nodejs (http://nodejs.org)
* Need to install mocha (npm install -g mocha)
* Run mocha -R list test/Classify.functional to run functional tests
* Run mocha -R list test/Classify.verifications to run verifications tests (should only pass when compiled with checks)

Or you can:

* Run Classifly.all.html in your browser (these contain the functional and verifications)
* Run Classifly.function.html in your browser (these contain the functional tests only)
* Run Classifly.verifications.html in your browser (these contain the verifications tests only)
